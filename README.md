# rob8_emotion
This GitHub project is the repository for Rob8 groups work in emotion recognition in human robot interaction.
The repo is divided into three categories, that reflects the 3 different topics, emotion recognition, cobot implementation and stress recognition.


# Emotion Recognition
The following section contains the python scripts that has been used for training and development of a VA-regressor.
This has been implemented through google colab. The collection is essentialy a collection of the different notebooks that has been usd for training.
The Notebook folder contains the independent notebooks. The weights for the different models can be found here(only for AAU people...):

AffectNet.ipynb is the file used to train and evaluate all the models on the AffectNet dataset.
OMG.ipynb is the file used to evaluate the trained CNN regressor on the AffectNet dataset on the

# Cobot Implementation
The following section contains the code that has been used to develop the cobot, that has been used in the human robot interaction.


# Stress Detection
The following section contains the code that has been used for stress detection based on the developed VA regressor.
