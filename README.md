# rob8_emotion
This GitHub project is the repository for Rob8 groups work in emotion recognition in human robot interaction.
The repo is divided into three categories, that reflects the 3 different topics, emotion recognition, cobot implementation and stress recognition.


# Emotion Recognition
The following section contains the python scripts that has been used for training and development of a VA-regressor.
This has been implemented through google colab. The collection is essentialy a collection of the different notebooks that has been usd for training. The weights for the different models can be found here(only for AAU people...):

The VA_regressor folder contains a several VA-regressors setup in TensorFlow, that can be used to perform prediction on a webcam. The models need to be downloaded from the link above <br/>
The Notebook folder contains the independent notebooks. Most importantly are the following two, the test is several trials on other datasets <br/>
AffectNet.ipynb is the file used to train and evaluate all the models on the AffectNet dataset. <br/>
OMG.ipynb is the file used to evaluate the trained CNN regressor on the AffectNet dataset on the

# Cobot Implementation
The following section contains the code that has been used to develop the cobot, that has been used in the human robot interaction.


# Stress Detection
The following section contains the code that has been used for stress detection based on the developed VA regressor.
